## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

Today we will create Trello accounts (if you haven't already done so) and gain access to the ACA_311_HACKATHON Trello board.

### Creating a Trello Account

Create a Trello account by navigating to [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) and clicking the "Sign Up" button on the top right. Sign up with either traditional or Google authentication. **Use the same email as the one you signed up with Zollege & Canvas!**

Paste the email you used to sign up for Trello in the class RocketChat so that the instructor can "invite" you to the board ([ACA_Hackathon](https://trello.com/b/wUbVNAWo/aca311hackathon)). The RocketChat message should look like this:

`Trello access - <EMAIL ADDRESS>`

Start looking at the tasks on the list and deciding who will do what. You can be assigning yourself to the tickets that you think you can handle. Each person should have an even amount of tickets (or close). You should also get a feel for which order you believe the tasks need to happen in. Obviously choose the first tasks first. For example, you must set up Express before you can begin building routes or integrating MySQL. Don't worry, the instructor will act as an over-arching project manager for this assignment.

### Project Instructions

We will use the following repo for both days this week. We will start work on the API today and finish next class. The API Hackathon is intended to re-enforce concepts and make you very comfortable creating these in the future. Your role as a full-stack or back-end developer will depend partially on this skill set.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [API HACKATHON](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk5_both_api_hackathon)
- [ ] Follow the `README` and Trello board to create a Node/Express API with MySQL from scratch.

    > Note: There is no follow-up video or further learning this week
