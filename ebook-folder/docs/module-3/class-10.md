- [ ] Student Presentations
- [ ] Creation Time
    * [ ] Wrap up API from last class
    * [ ] Review scrum practices and practice them
    * [ ] Turn In final teamAPI-PR assignment
- [ ] Review Checkpoint-2 Specs
- [ ] Blog to Show You Know
- [ ] Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders

### Student Presentations, 15 mins

[See Student Presentations List](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md)

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

Finish working on the API from last class. There should be a little more team rhythm today as we have figured out how to work with each other best. Also, towards the end (especially with SQL), tasks can be broken down a little more granularly and many people can work on the API at once.

### API Hackathon - Project Instructions

- [ ] Continue work on the following repository: [API HACKATHON](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk5_both_api_hackathon)
- [ ] **Make sure tickets are being moved across the Trello board when they are completed.**

## Checkpoint Two - Data Model for your Capstone App

Throughout this course and the next you will begin giving consideration to (and building) your final/Capstone App. The data need for this app will be the focus of this Checkpoint 2.

You are going to lay out the data model that you'll use in our final project/Capstone App. You might be creating an ecommerce project, or a weather app, or perhaps you don't even know what you want to create. This is the time to figure it out. (*Hopefully not because you've been doing presentations over the app*) To complete this Checkpoint you'll need to plan the API for the app and build the data model.

### Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Repo named after your Capstone App's title.
- [ ] List of Data Needs in `README.md`.
- [ ] Tables, Fields, and Relationships listed in `README.md`.
- [ ] Copy of ER diagrams saved in Repo.
- [ ] Steps to create DB on GCP Instance, How to connect to it with Workbench, and how to seed it with data written in `README.md`.
- [ ] Files with SQL commands to initialize the data.

### Instructions

- [ ] Decide what the focus of your final project will be. Write it down.
- [ ] Create a name for this app/project.
- [ ] Create new repo titled the name of your app with a `README.md` file.
- [ ] In the `README.md`, list out the data you think you'll need for this app.
    * [ ] Categorize the data into tables
    * [ ] Define relationships between those tables
- [ ] Using any digital tool you like, construct an ER diagram that communicates those tables, their relationships and their fields/properties.
- [ ] Save a copy of this ER Diagram in the repo.
- [ ] Review the steps to create a DB, connect to it, seed it with data and write them down in the `README.md`.
- [ ] Write the SQL Commands that would create the tables in files named after the data like: `userSeedData.sql`, `carSeedData.sql`, `productSeedData.sql`, etc...
- [ ] Store those files in the repo
- [ ] Upload the repo's link to the Checkpoint-2 Assignment
