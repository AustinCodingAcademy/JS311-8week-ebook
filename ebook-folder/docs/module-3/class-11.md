## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

We should have followed the pre-work and gained a deeper understanding surrounding ER diagrams and how to read them. In today's class we will import a sample database from MySQL and create an ER diagram. We will then answer some questions about it in order to re-enforce our understanding.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following [repository: ER Diagrams](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk6_day1_er)
- [ ] Follow the README to import data, create an ER diagram and answer questions about it
- [ ] [YT, Coding Passive Income - MySQL Triggers](https://youtu.be/NCEGs4RwAiM)

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Read [this article to understand database triggers](https://www.siteground.com/kb/mysql-triggers-use/).
- [ ] Follow along in MySQL Workbench to create the example described in the article

    > Note: triggers can be dangerous because they are basically "set and forget". Make sure your database is well documented
