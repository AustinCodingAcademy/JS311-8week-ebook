### Node/NPM Recap

Today we'll recap Node.js and NPM. The goal of this assignment is to complete a set of functions so that all of the tests pass. Additionally, one set of functions will use a popular NPM package, moment.js, to help us format dates and times.

 - [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [Node Practice](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS311-node-practice).
- [ ] Follow the `README` to complete the functions and make all the tests pass.

### Learn to Use Postman

Today you'll download Postman and become familiar with its interface for making API calls. The instructor will come around to ensure the tool is correctly installed and you have an understanding of its purpose.

* [YT, Raghav Pal - Postman Tutorial Ep. 1: What is Postman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juldrxDrSH0&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C)
* [Postman Docs - Install & Introduction](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates/)

- [ ] [Download Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
- [ ] Open the application.
- [ ] Make a `GET` request to the Star Wars API: `https://swapi.dev/api`.
- [ ] You should have received a list of available endpoints . . . make a request to the `planets` one.
- [ ] What's the diameter of `Naboo`?

  > Back up: In case SWAPI isn't up use [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/)

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] [Repl.it, Matt Viteri - Word Count](https://replit.com/@MattViteri/Word-Count)
- [ ] Using Postman and the Pokemon API:
    *  [ ] Use the Pokemon API to find the Pokemon `Charizard`.
    *  [ ] The base URL is: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/`.
    *  [ ] Make a GET request and use a path parameter of the Pokemon's name to access information about it.
    *  [ ] Use the information provided to lookup `Charizard`'s "type".
    *  [ ] Access the corresponding endpoint to find more details about the "fire" type.
    *  [ ] Locate the list of moves associated with this type.
