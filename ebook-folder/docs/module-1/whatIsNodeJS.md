# What is Node.js

While the name of the course you are starting may be called JavaScript 311 it's important to remember that JavaScript's native home is the browser. In all of its lifetime the only place JavaScript could be read was in the browser for use on the internet.

It is only recently that JavaScript has been able to be run on a computer or server. Strangely enough, this is how many web apps are built now, with full "JavaScript" front and back ends. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript is able to do many more things than it could do pre-2009. All this to say, what you'll be working in, while it looks like JavaScript, behaves like JavaScript and is based in JavaScript, is really Node.js.

Node.js is a language built on JavaScript using Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Built by Ryan Dahl and first released in 2009, its many powers include the importing and exporting of modules. Remember the giant library of libraries discussed in Web 101? This is it. Node is the giant library and each of these modules are called "libraries". This means that we could build a module with really cool functions, push it to Node and then someone else could find it and use it for their project. This also means we could do the same.

After you've installed it you should be able to go to the Terminal/Bash/CommandPrompt and type in `node -v` and get an output of `v10.16.0` or something close to that.
