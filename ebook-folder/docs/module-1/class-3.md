    > This video is an hour and fourteen minutes long but it covers all the topics we learned today. It uses Express and Postman. You might try listening at 1.5x speed but you should definitely follow along.

### Push Yourself Further

Follow along with this [tutorial on installing and setting up express](https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-js-express-tutorial/). This article includes concepts like "middleware" which we practiced with body-parser but haven't talked about in depth yet.
