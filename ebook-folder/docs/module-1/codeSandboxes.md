# Coding in a Sandbox

Code sandboxes are really useful tools to share ideas, play with possibilities and explore new concepts without the pressures of building your file structure, setting up your machine or depending on the console. In class we'll use [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/){:target="_blank"} to share snippets of code and to provide a place for practice and discovery. Get in the habit of browsing and playing with these small code snippets as you work through the ebook. It's where "the rubber meets the road", so to speak. Sandboxes are where you actually get to apply the concepts you just learned about PLUS you will frequently use them in your new career to test code in a controlled environment.

There are plenty of sandboxes to play in: [CodePen](http://codepen.io/){:target="_blank"} , [Repl.it](https://repl.it/login?goto=%2Frepls){:target="_blank"}, [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,js,output){:target="_blank"}, [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/){:target="_blank"} and [more](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/){:target="_blank"}! Get your hands dirty and explore for yourself!
