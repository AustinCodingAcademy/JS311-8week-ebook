# Interview Challenges

## Why Train for Interviews?

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor):

## How to Solve Your Challenge

- [ ] Restate the question aloud.
- [ ] Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Ask any clarifying questions you need.
- [ ] Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up.
Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard.
Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!
- [ ] Build the structure of your function(s).
- [ ] Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need.
- [ ] Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud.
- [ ] It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution!
- [ ] After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home.

<!-- 2. [Class 2](01Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *Reverse an array of strings such at input= "red","black","blue","yellow" output = "yellow","blue","black","red"*
    * **Prompt 2**: *How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?*
3. [Class 3](02Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?*
        i.e. `sumPairs(arr, 16)` => `[8, 8], [14, 2], [10, 16], [1, 15], [32, -16]`
    * **Prompt 2**: *How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?*
4. [Class 4](02Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other? Build a program that does just that.*
5. [Class 5](03Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How can a given string be reversed using recursion? Build a program to do that.*
6. [Class 6](03Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How is a binary search tree implemented?*
7. [Class 7](04Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you count a number of leaf nodes in a given binary tree?*
8. [Class 8](04Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you perform a binary search in a given array?*
9. [Class 9](05Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you implement an insertion sort algorithm?*
10. [Class 10](05Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you implement a bucket sort algorithm?*
11. [Class 11](06Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How is a radix sort algorithm implemented? Build one.*
12. [Class 12](06Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *How do you swap two numbers without using the third variable?*
13. [Class 13](07Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *Define a function that returns n lines of [Pascalâ€™s Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle).*
14. [Class 14](07Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *Use recursion to log a fibonacci sequence of n length.*
15. [Class 15](08Week/01DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *Define a function that takes an array of strings, and returns the most commonly occurring string that array*
16. [Class 16](08Week/02DayClass.md) -
    * **Prompt 1**: *You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results are negative.) However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?*

        *Write code to simulate your approach.* -->
