Today we are going to work on the CRUD operations of our database again but this time all the operations will be in an Express app. After today we will have a fully functioning API attached to an SQL database. We still have a few more things to do in this course but at this point you should be proud because we've gotten through the meat of it! More best practices such as authentication to come . . .

In the example below we see how to parse this immense data into just what we need, dynamically.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [Node MySQL](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk4_day2_node_mysql)
- [ ] Follow the `README` to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` records from an Express app
    
    > Here's a cool video about wrapping the callbacks from the connection pool in promises. More importantly, this video handles Express and MySQL from **start --> finish**!

### Push Yourself Further

There are a couple semi-advanced concepts in SQL that we haven't covered yet, but that's ok. The bulk of our time has been prioritizing the necessities. That being said, if you really want to take it to the next level (AND YOU SHOULD) you can spend some time on your own learning about `transactions` and `stored procedures`.
