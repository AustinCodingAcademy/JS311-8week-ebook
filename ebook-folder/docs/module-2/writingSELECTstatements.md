Don't worry about doing everything in the following video. For now, just watch how SELECT statements work.

We are going to attempt three different SELECT statements on the data. IMPORTANT: delete each statement after running it successfully as the sandbox can only run one SQL statement at a time.

- [ ] Select all of the users from the users table. This should return 8 users and you will see the id increment from 1-8
- [ ] Select only the users where their age is greater than 25. This should return 6 users. (Matt & Amber excluded)
- [ ] Select only the users where their firstNames look like they begin with the letter "d". There should only be 2 users (Dan & Donald)
- [ ] Try returning all the users whose last name ends with 'y'
- [ ] Try returning all the users whose first name ends with 'e'
