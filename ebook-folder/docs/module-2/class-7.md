Today we are going to work on the CRUD operations of our database. We will practice `INSERT`ing, `UPDATE`ing and `DELETE`ing records from our tables and use our existing knowledge of `SELECT` to help us verify the changes we made. After this lesson we should have everything we need to interact with SQL databases.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following repository: [SQL CRUD](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk4_day1_crud)
- [ ] Follow the `README.md` to `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` records.
- [ ] [YT, the Bad Tutorials - SQL Tutorial 25: ORDER BY](https://youtu.be/6YGvqrwQ9d4)

    > NOTE: As mentioned before, we will often want to check to make sure the inserts, updates or deletes worked as expected, and we do that by running a `SELECT` query on the data to view it.
    > NOTE 2: One important clause that we haven't talked about yet is the `ORDER BY` [clause](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp). It will help you order the data in your tables by a field or group of fields. For example, if you just inserted a record, you may want to perform a `SELECT` statement in descending "order by" `id` so that the newest record is at the top. The video above will explain this clause.

### Push Yourself Further

The following document covers `INSERT`s, `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s as well as commands to create and drop tables and databases. Additionally, the `DISTINCT` [command](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp) will give you an easy way to de-dupe result sets.

- [ ] Review the following document on [most popular sql commands](https://www.webhostface.com/blog/most-popular-mysql-commands/)
- [ ] Continue using the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) to further your learning. You will need to continuously reference docs like this in order to know how to write your SQL statements. Additionally, Google searches like "MySQL find all records that start with A" can be helpful in pointing you to Stack Overflow articles on the appropriate topic. The key is knowing what to search for. Often it's easier than you think.
