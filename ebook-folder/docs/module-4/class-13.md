### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

We're going to follow the instructions in the README.md to deploy our application and then test the hosted application. Additionally, here is a ["Hello World" example](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/getting-started/hello-world) of deploying to App Engine from Google's docs.

At the end of this class our API will be hosted and accessible via a public facing URL.

- [ ] Fork and clone the following [repository: App Engine Deployment](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/311_wk7_day1_deployment)
- [ ] Follow the `README` to deploy your API
- [ ] [YT, Chris Parsons - Google Cloud Platform with Node.js](https://youtu.be/n4svrNcAkJg)

### Push Yourself Further

Attempt to replicate the steps in this lesson for a different project, maybe your graduation project . . . or try to find an older API we've created that doesn't use MySQL to make things easier.

- [ ] Navigate to a different project
- [ ] Ensure an `app.yaml` file exists
- [ ] Run `gcloud app deploy`
- [ ] Ensure the app is running as we expect

    > Note: Only one application can be hosted on App Engine at a time so this will overwrite the current homework assignment...FYI
