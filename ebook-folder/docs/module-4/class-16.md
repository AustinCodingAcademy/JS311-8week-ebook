## Push Yourself Further

If you've built your SQL database and connected it to your Express server then add a layer of authentication so your app can be deployed soon.

> IMPORTANT: In your next class we will focus on the frontend using React. We'll no longer be working on SQL and Express but it's important that you retain these skills, work on your backend and reference this textbook regularly. You are building a full-stack application to show to the world and prove to employers you are worth the salary you hope to gain.

Use the time between classes to complete your backend so when you have the front-end skills you can easily connect them and host a fully functioning, impressive web app to show to your friends, family, and employers.
