# JS311 Wrap-Up

*In every difficult situation is potential value. Believe this, then begin looking for it. —Norman Vincent Peale*

## Overview

Throughout this course we've learned all the necessary information to create APIs. We should be feeling like back-end engineers! You may have found this course easier (or harder) than doing work on the frontend (HTML) and that's ok. That just means you've developed a preference for which side of the stack you'd rather work on. You'll continue to flex your skills on the frontend in the next course but with more logic and dynamic abilities.

To recap, we've learned how to develop and app in [Node](https://nodejs.org/) using the Node Package Manager, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which gives us access to download and use packages like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to build servers more easily than doing it ourselves because it has built-in tools to manage [Routes & Controllers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). Along with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) we're able to make use of [Node's mysql package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) so we can create all of the MySql [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) statements including [INSERT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html), [SELECT](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-select-statement-query-data.aspx), [UPDATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html), and [DELETE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/mysql-delete-query.htm).

We've also learned how to use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to connect to a [Database Instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance), initialize the data, and  [Model the Data with ERDs](https://www.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/).

In addition to securing our server's routes with a third-party like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/create-a-simple-and-secure-node-express-app/), we've also learned how to deploy our server using [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) on teh [GCS/GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and migrate our code with a [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) pipeline tool called [CloudBees CodeShip](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/codeship/overview).

## For Tomorrow

1. **Presentation**

  Start creating a 3-minute presentation about what you've learned in this course. This could be a slideshow or a live coding demonstration surrounding your final project. Be prepared to share some of your learnings during our last class. Don't worry if you aren't the best public speaker . . . it's important to develop these skills as you will soon be collaborating with real teams!

2. **Continue Building**

  As you've see in the past day of class we will have time to work on our graduation project. You should have already been able to model your data, develop your SQL database, and even create an ER Diagram with Workbench. Tonight let's work on our Express server.

  Hopefully you've made some plans of the routes you'll need and controllers that will be used. (If you haven't, let's do that now.) If you have, let's start coding those. Remember, you can use any one of the projects we've worked on so far to have a framework and starting point. All routes and controllers look the same with a few values changed here and there. Copy/paste until you have a working server. Remember to use Postman to test as you go and [connect it to your SQL Database](https://studio.zollege.com/jump_to_id/73df0099d5594f1f9b3f5fa92ead787c).

  Tomorrow in class after presentations we'll all work with the help of your instructor to continue building your server.

## Additional Resources

- To be a successful developer you need to have the curiosity and passion to problem solve. Start practicing each night with the puzzles given to you in the [Interview Challenges](./../additionalResources/interviewChallenges.md) and start looking for others at places like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
