The final checkpoint in this course is the hosted REST API which will be used as the back-end server for the front-end app they build in their 411 course. These two pieces will come together to create a full-stack application that students will present to the public at graduation as their Capstone Project. Class Structure and Expectations This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy! Due dates : Homework is due the Sunday after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE! Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the Submission Due Day , i.e. Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday. Assignments turned in after the Submission Due Day will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible. The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty. The Final Submission Day for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends. Assignments turned in after the Final Submission Day will receive an automatic grade of 50. Homework submission : Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Homework guidelines : Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete. Grading : You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment. Late policy : You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class. Exceptions : If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements.

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor): How to Solve Your Challenge Restate , rewrite , and clarify the question. Write the expected return given the input. Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team. Test and come up with edge cases. Revise if you can for efficiency. Restate, Rewrite, Clarify, Return, Plan, Collaborate, Code, Test, Revise Restate the question aloud. Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard. Ask any clarifying questions you need. Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up. Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard. Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! Build the structure of your function(s). Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need. Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud. It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution! After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home. The Prompts Class 1 Prompt 1: Using HTTP and APIs - All together at the same time. We'll hear thoughts and discussion afterward. Write out the URI to get an individual character from the Star Wars API. Highlight the pieces of the URI and explain what they mean. Explain what is included in an HTTP request message. Write it out and explain the parts. Explain what is included in an HTTP response message. Write it out and explain the parts. Diagram what happens when a client makes a GET request. What is included in the request? - [ ] What is included in the response? Diagram a POST request to create a resource. What is included in the request? What is included in the response? Class 2 Prompt 1: sumOneForOne - There are two arrays with individual values. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of each individual index value from the given arrays. 1 2 3 4 5 6 let array1 = [ 1 , 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]; let array2 = [ 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 13 ]; const sumOneForOne = () => { /*your code here*/ } sumOneForOne ( array1 , array2 ) // => [4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13] Prompt 2: RESTful Design - Design a REST API for a photo album site. What resources would the API support? What operations can be done on those resources, and what HTTP verb would be used for each? What would the body of a request and response look like for each operation? For this first whiteboarding challenge, the instructor will lead the discovery. The Instructor will lead this discussion with input from the class. Class 3 Prompt 1: Title - Your customer has sa list of volume, which you have neatly stored into an array. One of the properties of each volume is a protection policy. The customer wants their users to be able to apply a protection policy to new volumes globally, if all of the existing volumes have the same policy. You need to write a function that returns a boolean. true , meaning all the policies in the array are the same, or false , meaning at least one policy in the array is different from another. The caveat here is, new volumes are also in this array, and their policy is denoted as a special string '--:--' . This means there is no policy on the volume and thus, the volume is new. If all the policies in the array are the same, we can apply that policy globally TO the new volumes, else, we cannot, and will have to go new-volume by new-volume, applying policies individually. Policies are denoted with characters 'A' 'B' 'C' or 'D'. New volume policies are denoted with the special string '--:--' . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 INPUT: [ {policy: 'A'}, {policy: 'A'}, {policy: '--:--'}, {policy: '--:--'}, {policy: 'A'}, {policy: 'A'},] OUTPUT: true, set global policy INPUT: [ {policy: 'A'}, {policy: 'B'}, {policy: '--:--'}, {policy: '--:--'}, {policy: 'A'}, {policy: 'C'},] OUTPUT: false, prevent global policy With this data, build a function that determines if setting a global policy is possible or not. Class 4 Prompt 1: getNArray - Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. BUT passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array. 1 2 3 4 5 getNArray ([ 7 , 9 , 0 , - 2 ]); // --> 7 getNArray ([], 3 ); // --> [] getNArray ([ 7 , 9 , 0 , - 2 ], 3 ); // --> [7, 9, 0] getNArray ([ 7 , 9 , 0 , - 2 ], 6 ); // --> [7, 9, 0, -2] getNArray ([ 7 , 9 , 0 , - 2 ], - 3 ); // --> [] Class 5 Prompt 1: ArrayClone - Write a JavaScript function to clone an array. 1 2 console . log ( cloneArray ([ 1 , 2 , 4 , 0 ])); // => [1, 2, 4, 0] console . log ( cloneArray ([ 1 , 2 , [ 4 , 0 ]])); // => [1, 2, [4, 0]] Class 6 Prompt 1: Binary Search - Write a JavaScript program to perform a binary search. Note: A binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a specified input value within an array sorted by key value.* 1 2 3 4 5 // Sample array : const items = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]; // Expected Output : console . log ( binary_Search ( items , 1 )); // --> 0 console . log ( binary_Search ( items , 5 )); // --> 4 Class 7 Prompt 1: deDup - Given a sorted array of numbers, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once and return the new length. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 function deDup ( array ){ // ...your code here... } let test1 = [ 1 , 1 , 2 ]; console . log ( deDup ( test1 )) // 2 console . log ( test1 ) //[1,2,null] let test2 = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 ]; console . log ( deDup ( test2 )) // 5 console . log ( test2 ); // [1,2,3,4,5,null,null,null,null] let test3 = [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 ]; console . log ( deDup ( test3 )) // 5 console . log ( test3 ) // [1,2,3,4,5] let test4 = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]; console . log ( deDup ( test4 )) // 9 console . log ( test4 ) //[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] Class 8 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 9 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 10 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 11 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 12 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 13 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 14 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 15 Prompt 1: Title - description Class 16 Prompt 1: Title - description","title":"Interview Training"},{"location":"additionalResources/interviewChallenges/#interview-challenges","text":"","title":"Interview Challenges"},{"location":"additionalResources/interviewChallenges/#why-train-for-interviews","text":"Interviewing for development jobs is tough!

One of the properties of each volume is a protection policy.

You need to write a function that returns a boolean. true , meaning all the policies in the array are the same, or false , meaning at least one policy in the array is different from another. The caveat here is, new volumes are also in this array, and their policy is denoted as a special string '--:--' . This means there is no policy on the volume and thus, the volume is new. If all the policies in the array are the same, we can apply that policy globally TO the new volumes, else, we cannot, and will have to go new-volume by new-volume, applying policies individually. Policies are denoted with characters 'A' 'B' 'C' or 'D'.

Patton Overview In this course, we're going to learn how to build an API using Node.js and Express . If you don't know exactly what an \"API\" is, why you'd want to build one, or how Express fits in, don't worry! That's why we're here. What's an API? A traditional software application has a user interface( UI ): a mechanism that allows a person to interact with the software. It may be a graphical user interface, a web-based user interface, a text-based user interface, or a voice interface. Whatever form it takes, the user interface is a way for a person to tell the software what they want to do. But what if we want to let other software interact with our application, rather than a person? A user interface built for human interaction isn't well-suited for programmatic interaction. That's where APIs come in. API is an acronym that stands for A pplication P rogramming I nterface. In its most general sense, an API is a well-defined way for one computer program to interact with another program. More technically, an API is a set of functions and data structures that allow other application developers to leverage the functionality and/or data of your software within their own applications. There are many different ways to implement an API, so the term can be somewhat ambiguous. There are high-level APIs and low-level APIs, internal APIs and public APIs, and so on, but in all cases they help different programs interact. Let's look at two examples. Example One - Native API If you are building a desktop application that runs on macOS or Windows, you will likely want your app to have menus and buttons and windows and other familiar user interface elements. You could build these things from scratch, drawing each pixel and handling every keystroke and mouse click in your code in order to make it look and act like other software, but that's a LOT of work ! Fortunately, the creators of macOS and Windows provided APIs that make your life as an application developer much easier. These APIs provide many functions (methods) that can help you create menus and buttons, respond to mouse clicks, etc. Other functions might help you interact with the file system or determine who is currently logged in. These APIs are building blocks that make it easier for application developers to create new software by giving your application well-defined ways to interact with the features of the operating system. Example Two - Web API The HTML APIs you learned in Web 101 like Canvas, Geolocation and Drag and Drop. These are also APIs because they provide the developer(you) with functionality that can be accessed through property names like .getContext() or isdraggable= . These are built into the HTML language but not implicitly used or required, yet are available by simply knowing their property names. Pretty cool, right? Example Three - REST API Let's say you're building a tourism mobile app with detailed information about the historical sites in your city. You'd also like to provide the traveler with a list of highly-rated restaurants that are near each site. You could gather this information yourself and include it in your app, but restaurants come and go, ratings change, and it's somewhat outside of the main scope of your app. Besides, other apps like Yelp already have this pretty well covered. Fortunately, Yelp provides an API that you can use to leverage their business data and ratings. Using their API, your app can search for nearby restaurants that are rated 4 stars or higher and conveniently display them alongside the site the traveler is currently viewing. Which Are We Building? There's a subtle difference between the examples we just covered. In the first, your desktop app is running on a computer right alongside the operating system. Your app and the operating system can interact directly. In the second, you are accessing objects built-into the language itself. In the third example, your app is running on a smart phone. Does the person using your app need to have the Yelp app installed? Is your tourism app talking directly to the Yelp mobile app? No, it's not. Your app is using a remote API . It communicates with a remote server located somewhere in \"the cloud\". More precisely, your app communicates over the internet with server software made by Yelp, which is running on a computer in some data center, and that software was specifically designed to allow other programs to interact with it in a well-defined way. Each of these examples can be termed APIs, but it is APIs in the third example, a remote RESTful APIs , that we will be building in this course, using a specific architectural style known as a REST API. We'll get into the details of REST APIs later. For now, just be aware that when many people say \"API\" they often mean this specific kind of remote API known as a RESTful API . But APIs come in many forms and you'll undoubtedly become familiar with many different types in your career. Following is a short video that explains the concept of APIs and how they enable the connectivity that we have become accustomed to in modern applications. See It - What's An API? Practice - Explore the Star Wars API Go to the Star Wars API site and experiment with it. The site gives you a simple UI and hints so you can try different API requests. Be sure to use the hints and see what the return values are. Visit the documentation page for a full explanation of what it offers and will allow you to do. Here are a few things to try: Try retrieving a few different people by changing the id value. What happens if you put in an invalid id value, such as 9999? Can you retrieve a list of all people? Discover other types of information you can access, besides people. Do you notice any common pattern for how you use the API? You can fork this CodePen or create your own repo to play with. What is REST REST stands for RE presentational S tate T ransfer. It is an architectural style\u2014a set of guiding principles\u2014for building distributed systems. This site provides an overview of these principles and the history of REST. Systems that adhere to these principles are commonly said to be RESTful . We're not going to focus too much on the theory behind REST. Instead, we'll focus on the practical application of REST to APIs, using common industry patterns. Still, there are a few terms and concepts that we must review. What is a Resource? A resource is key concept in REST. It's a general term that represents any information that can be named. Resources are often the basic data entities that our APIs work with, but they can also be more abstract concepts or processes. In the Star Wars API, the resources are things like \"people\", \"starships\", and \"planets\". Resources are commonly named using plural nouns. For example, to access information about the people in Star Wars, we use \"people\" rather than the singular \"person\". By convention, resource names are usually expressed as nouns rather than verbs or actions. E.g., planets rather than getPlanet , or StudentEnrollment rather than EnrollStudent . Occasionally, resources can also be more abstract concepts or processes. For example, a \"StudentEnrollment\" resource might be a multi-step process that updates Student and Class resources, while also enforcing rules about which classes a student can enroll in, sending notifications, and so on. The URI Part Resources are accessed using U niform R esource I dentifiers, or URI s. URIs are very similar to the familiar URL(UR Locator)) that we use on the web. There are subtle theoretical differences between URIs and URLs that we will not concern ourselves with, but you can read more about if you're interested. Let's revisit the URI that we used to access information about Luke Skywalker: https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 Part Explanation https://swapi.dev/api The base URL for accessing the API. This includes the protocol that will be used (https), the location of the API (swapi.dev), and a base path (/api). /people The resource we're accessing, \"people\" /1 An identifier that tells the API which person we're interested in Here's another example. Note that we don't specify an ID for any particular person. Instead, we're accessing all people. https://swapi.dev/api/people Part Explanation https://swapi.dev/api The base URL for accessing the API /people The resource we're accessing, \"people\" Client-Server You're going to hear the terms client and server a lot, so let's make sure we understand what they mean. The client-server model is a way of distributing work among multiple parts of a software system, with the parts often (but not necessarily) running on separate computers and communicating over a network. For example, when we click the https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 link, our web browser is the client . The computer at swapi.dev that sends back the data about Luke Skywalker is the server . In general, software making a request is a client . Software that listens for requests and sends back a response is a server . Request and response are important concepts that we'll be working with as we build APIs. HTTP/HTTPS HTTP is the protocol that clients and servers use to communicate on the web. HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP in which the information being exchanged is encrypted. The first part of a URI (e.g., HTTP:) indicates which protocol is being used so the client and server know how to talk to each other\u2014 it sets the rules for the conversation . Technically, a REST API can use any protocol to communicate, but in practice they usually use HTTP or HTTPS. HTTP has two types of messages: requests and responses . We won't necessarily be creating request and response messages from scratch\u2014we have frameworks and other tools to help with that\u2014but we will be working with some of their parts and it is good to have a mental picture of what these messages look like. A request message/object is made up of the following parts: Part Explanation Request Method Also commonly called the verb, the request method indicates what type of action we're requesting. Some commonly used methods are GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST. Path The path to the resource that we're working with. Headers A collection of colon-separated key-value pairs that can be used to provide additional context about the request, e.g. Content-Type: application/json (which indicates that the content of the body will be in JSON format.) Body A payload that can be sent with the request. A response message/object has these parts: Part Explanation Status Code / Message A numeric code and short message that indicate whether the request was successful. Headers A collection of colon-separated key-value pairs that can be used to provide additional context about the response, e.g., Content-Type: application/json indicates that the content of the body is in JSON format. Body A payload that can be sent with the response. You can find more detailed information about HTTP here . Interacting with a REST API Up to this point, we've interacted with the Star Wars API by using a browser. This is convenient but limiting. The browser's address bar and links can only make one type of request, known as a GET request, which is used (unsurprisingly) to get a resource. But what if we want to create, update, or delete a resource? We either have to write code or use another tool. Fortunately, there is a powerful and free tool called Postman that we can use to more fully interact with REST APIs. Beyond GET: HTTP Verbs The Star Wars API was a useful starting place, but it only allows us to retrieve information. In the following video, we'll look at another API , provided by Ben Howdle, and dig in to the full range of request types and how they're used in REST APIs. First we'll explore the API using the interface provided by the website and then we'll use Postman to interact with the API. Additional Resources Article, RestfulAPI - What is REST?

It may be a graphical user interface, a web-based user interface, a text-based user interface, or a voice interface. Whatever form it takes, the user interface is a way for a person to tell the software what they want to do. But what if we want to let other software interact with our application, rather than a person? A user interface built for human interaction isn't well-suited for programmatic interaction. That's where APIs come in. API is an acronym that stands for A pplication P rogramming I nterface. In its most general sense, an API is a well-defined way for one computer program to interact with another program. More technically, an API is a set of functions and data structures that allow other application developers to leverage the functionality and/or data of your software within their own applications. There are many different ways to implement an API, so the term can be somewhat ambiguous. There are high-level APIs and low-level APIs, internal APIs and public APIs, and so on, but in all cases they help different programs interact. Let's look at two examples.","title":"What's an API?"},{"location":"module-1/REST-HTTP-APIs/#example-one-native-api","text":"If you are building a desktop application that runs on macOS or Windows, you will likely want your app to have menus and buttons and windows and other familiar user interface elements.

Fortunately, the creators of macOS and Windows provided APIs that make your life as an application developer much easier. These APIs provide many functions (methods) that can help you create menus and buttons, respond to mouse clicks, etc. Other functions might help you interact with the file system or determine who is currently logged in. These APIs are building blocks that make it easier for application developers to create new software by giving your application well-defined ways to interact with the features of the operating system.","title":"Example One - Native API"},{"location":"module-1/REST-HTTP-APIs/#example-two-web-api","text":"The HTML APIs you learned in Web 101 like Canvas, Geolocation and Drag and Drop.

We are also going to get familiar with the common HTTP protocols and status codes. Axios Axios works just like fetch() but is a more robust. It's also a replacement because fetch() is only available in the browser. When we're working in Node, we're on the server so we have a need for an HTTP client, therefore we use a package like Axios. In the past, fetch has served our needs just fine and it may continue to do so for many people, but our goal here is to introduce a popular alternative. Some notable differences: No more response.json() More configurable Custom error handling Axios can be installed via NPM ( npm i axios ) and called just like fetch: axios('https://someurl') . No matter which HTTP client you use, you will always have to deal with the same web standards/protocols for APIs: Before you continue, read about HTTP requests . We need to understand the methods, headers and body. HTTP Requests Each API request (using fetch() or axios() ) will contain a method. These methods help computers (and humans) determine how the request is intended to function. There are four main methods: GET A GET request tells an application that we are requesting some sort of information. This could include reading data from a database or a text file. It could also include returning a random number. It depends on what is applicable for the system. A key differentiator for this type of request is that a GET request contains no body. 1 2 3 4 5 axios . get ( '/user?ID=12345' ) . then ( function ( response ) { // handle success console . log ( response ); }) POST A POST request tells an application that it needs to create something.

This method tells the application/server that something needs to be changed or updated. PUT requests will also send along a body to help the application decide what needs to be altered. 1 2 3 4 axios . put ( '/user?ID=12345' , { firstName : 'Fred' , lastName : 'Flintstone' }) DELETE A DELETE request may or may not have a body but its purpose is to remove something from an application, hence the keyword \"delete\".1 1 2 3 4 5 axios . delete ( '/user?ID=12345' ) . then ( function ( response ) { // handle success console . log ( response ); }) When you build an app for graduation and to get a job with these 4 methods you will have built a CRUD app: Create, Read, Update, Delete. YT, Telusko - HTTP Requests HTTP Status Codes Each time we send a request we will get a response back and that response will include a status code. The objective of the status code is to tell us the results of the request. For instance, a request could have been successful, failed to find information or couldn't find the desired resource/server. These codes tell us what went right and what went wrong. 200 - There are multiple variations of the 200 status code including 201 and 204, but generally anything in the 200 range indicates a successful response. Things went according to plan. 300 - Status codes in the 300s are used for caching, proxy or SEO purposes. The main one is a 301 redirect which means a resource was \"moved permanently\". We won't run into these codes much in this class. In fact, you won't run into them that often in your career unless you do a lot of networking related tasks. 400 - 400 status codes mean something went wrong with the request. There are lots of variations of these so we will cover a few. The main ones are: 400 - Bad Request_: This is a generic \"something is wrong\" status code. You will need to change your request and try again. 401 - Unauthorized_: You've likely forgotten an API key or some other Authorization header required to complete the request. This is usually temporary. 403 - Forbidden_: Similar to a 401, this indicates that the server understands the request but is going to block it anyway. This is more permanent. For example: incorrect access rights. 404 - Not Found_: You may have seen this one before! This means that the requested resource could not be found. 500 - Status codes in the 500s mean something is really wrong. A 500 (Internal Server Error) could be an uncaught exception in your code. A 502 (Bad Gateway) or a 503 (Service Unavailable) may indicate an infrastructure problem. Perhaps your server is down. Status Code Summary A lot to take in? Don't worry, you'll learn these as you go. Like most things repetition helps. For this course, the two things we should take away from status codes are: We are generally looking for a 200 (OK) Typically the higher the number, the worse of an issue it is Practice It Instructions On your computer, create a new folder called sampleHTTP and navigate to it: cd sampleHTTP . Run the command npm init to initialize your project. READ THE WORDS PRINTED ON YOUR SCREEN!! Accept all the default options by hitting Enter over and over all the way through the last step: \"Is this OK? (yes)\". cd sampleHTTP : into the sampleHTTP folder npm i axios . Axios is the HTTP client we'll be using for this little project. Create a file called index.js in your project folder: touch index.js . Open this new directory in your text editor: code . Import axios on the first line: const axios = require('axios') . On the third line make a call to axios with the URL of ACA: axios('https://austincodingacademy.com/') . Use .then() to get the response and console.log it. 1 2 3 4 axios ( 'https://austincodingacademy.com/' ) . then ( function ( response ) { console . log ( response ) }) - [ ] Run the program ( node index.js ) - [ ] What is the status code? What is the response? NOTE: You're going to get a very long response, and you might not be able to scroll all the way to the top to see the status code. Try the following to get ONLY the response headers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 ```javascript axios.head('https://austincodingacademy.com/') .then(function (response) { console.log(response) }) ``` Additional Resources YT, Duomly - Fetch vs Axios YT, Traversy Media - Axios Crash Course Article, LogRocket - How to Make HTTP Requests with Axios.js Look ahead to the Questions for Student Led Discussion To be a successful developer you need to have the curiosity and passion to problem solve.

This is usually temporary. 403 - Forbidden_: Similar to a 401, this indicates that the server understands the request but is going to block it anyway. This is more permanent. For example: incorrect access rights. 404 - Not Found_: You may have seen this one before! This means that the requested resource could not be found. 500 - Status codes in the 500s mean something is really wrong. A 500 (Internal Server Error) could be an uncaught exception in your code. A 502 (Bad Gateway) or a 503 (Service Unavailable) may indicate an infrastructure problem. Perhaps your server is down.","title":"HTTP Status Codes"},{"location":"module-1/axios-HTTPstatusCodes/#status-code-summary","text":"A lot to take in? Don't worry, you'll learn these as you go.

The logic in those files is just plain JavaScript that uses Axios to fetch data. We create a folder called controllers/ and then put files in it called users.js , customers.js , etc. But first, why controllers? Why Controllers After we create Routers it makes sense to create controller files so as to separate and organize our code even more. Just like we talked about having clean code and separation of responsibilities in the routers section, the same applies here. Since we've already covered routers, let's start there. Take a look at the following code (and keep in mind that it is pseudo-code, not all syntax is exact): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // users.js file router . get ( '/users' , ( req , res ) => { const users = [] if ( req . body . query ) { // go find users that match that query const users = await db . find ( query ) } if ( ! users . length ) { // no users, throw error res . status ( 404 ). send ( 'No users found' ) } res . json ( users ) }) What we are looking at here is the size of the function. You might think this looks perfectly reasonable and I would agree with you in this specific example, but if we had a function that was 100 lines long then suddenly this does not seem so reasonable. Just like we don't want 50 routes in one file, we also don't want multiple routes that are 50-100 lines long. It becomes hard to understand what each is supposed to do. This is where the concept of controllers comes in. Again, a \"controller\" is not something specific to Express, it's just plain JavaScript we happen to call controller .

Our file structure will now start to look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 src/ - index.js - controllers/ - users.js - routers/ - users.js - customers.js - merchants.js - admins.js Now, in controllers/users.js we are going to take the code we saw above and put it in it's own function (to be exported): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 // controllers/users.js file const findWithQuery = () => { const users = [] if ( req . body . query ) { // go find users that match that query const users = await db . find ( query ) } if ( ! users . length ) { // no users, throw error res . status ( 404 ). send ( 'No users found' ) } res . json ( users ) } // exports each of the functions/methods we build as an object module . exports = { findWithQuery // other methods could be listed here with a ',' after each. } In this way we create a findWithQuery method on the users controller object we can call and use later with dot-notation.

In doing so we learned about routes and how they intercept various types of requests like PUT, POST, GET...etc. We also understand paths and callbacks function with the parameters req and res . In the last project we were putting all of the logic to get data inside the same file: index.js . This technique works and can be used but for large applications, aka, the ones you'll be working on after you graduate, you'll notice there's a different pattern implemented. Instead of keeping the data retrieving logic in the index.js file we'll separate it from the routes ( app.get() ...etc. into a different file and then import that logic into the index.js file and call it when the route is called. In short, we're going to move the parameters ( path and the callback function ) into a separate file called router .js, then move the callback function into a different file called controller .js. After that we'll import the logic of the controller into the router , give it to the appropriate route then import the router into the index.js file and assign it to the correct method! READY? Try to understand the three files below before moving on. Hint, its not doing anything different than what you've already done; but now, it's separated into 3 different files. src/index.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const express = require ( 'express' ) // import the router object and save to a variable called `router` const router = require ( './routers/' ) const app = express () app . use ( router . getUsers ) // ...more code here...blah...blah...app.listen() src/router.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 const express = require ( 'express' ) // save the functionality of Express's `router` as a variable called `router` const router = express .

Draw it so you have a visual guide as you learn how to implement this. Why Routers and Controllers Imagine that we have an Express app that has 50 routes in it. Where would you put them all? So far, it has just been our index.js (sometimes called server.js ) file, but is that really sustainable or scalable? Let's see: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 // index.js file const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () const port = process . env .

Fortunately, we have ways to get around that, which is where routers come in. Creating A Router A \"router\" is a functionality that is included in Express to make the above process easier for us to organize. Here's how it works. You: Create a new file (ex. users.js ) Create a new router (this will handle all users routers) Export the router Import the router into index.js .use() it as middleware (like body-parser ) Let's see an example: To keep it organized from the get go we'll make two folder first: routers/ and controllers/ In these two folders we'll keep their respective files: users.js and userController.js ...so forth and so forth. For now, let's create a new folder called routers and a file in it called users.js and copy/paste the following into it: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // src/routers/users.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const router = express . Router () // Now we simply use our \"router\" just like our \"app\" to create routes. router . get ( '/users' , ( req , res ) => { // perform some logic res . json ( users ) }) router . get ( '/users/:id' , ( req , res ) => { // perform some logic res . json ( user ) }) router . post ( '/users' , ( req , res ) => { // perform some logic res . send ( 'success' ) }) // And then we export the router: module . exports = router Now . . . we head back to index.js and we require this router : const users = require('./users') Finally, we use it as middleware like this: app.use(users) where \"users\" is the parameter we just imported above. So now our index.js file looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // src/index.js file const express = require ( 'express' ) const users = require ( './routers/users' ) const app = express () const port = process . env . PORT || 4000 app . use ( users ) app . listen ( port , () => console . log ( `Example app listening on port ${ port } !` )) This now works just as before except we don't have 50 routes defined in our index.js file. After we created routes for our other resources we might have a file that looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // src/index.js file //...more code here... app . use ( users ) app . use ( customers ) app . use ( merchants ) app . use ( admin ) //...more code here And those routes would all exist in their corresponding files: routers/customers.js , routers/merchants.js , routers/admin.js . Hopefully we can see how using routers allows us to write cleaner code in our index.js file as well as separate the responsibilities of our routes to keep the working parts of our app organized and easily accessible.

We've also practiced consuming APIs with both Postman and Axios. So far, the APIs we've interacted with are programs that someone else has built. With Express, we will start to understand how to build our own APIs. What is Express.js Express is a (very popular) NPM package that turns our Node.js applications into a web server. Express can help us serve static files (images, etc) or create routes to build API endpoints. We will use Express to build the \"backend\" of our application. Why do we need a web server (or backend), anyway? There are several reasons. One key reason is for the protection of sensitive content. On our front-ends (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), everything we code into the app will be visible from the browser in one way or another. That means that if you store an API key or some other sensitive token in a variable, eventually someone will be able to inspect the website (through the console) and obtain that information. This inspection is not possible with a web server built with Express. Another reason we use a server is that it is how we integrate with a database. We will become more familiar with databases in the following chapters but it's good to know that in the software industry (as a best practice) we don't connect to a database directly from the frontend, a React app for example. Most database systems don't even allow this interaction. So a web server helps us account for this as well. Express is an amazing tool that helps us quickly accomplish these tasks. Fortunately for us, there is a wealth of information available on Express and we will see some of that soon. For now, feel free to check out the Express Homepage . A breakdown of concepts: Initiating the Server The first thing we typically do after we import express is to instantiate the server. The first few lines of our server usually look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // index.js // import the Express package const express = require ( 'express' ) // create a variable to hold the value of all of the server's functions/methods const app = express () // Middleware: this block is where authorization logic goes. We're not going to worry about it too much right now. We'll get into the details of authorization in a few weeks. app . use (( req , res , next ) => { //authorization logic would go here, after the check it calls the next() method to all the request to go to the next phase: get, put, post, etc... next () }) // at the bottom of the index.js file you'll tell the server `app` to listen give you feed back in the console when it is. // use this method to give you feedback as to when the server is successfully spun up (up and running)! app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) }) If this was in an npm init ed folder with Express installed ( npm i express ) you could run npm start or node index.js and get 'Server is listening on port 8080.' on your console. Creating Routes After that we are free to start creating routes . The app object has properties on it already that include: .get , .put , .post and .delete (among others). These properties correspond to the HTTP request methods you learned about in 101, 211, and now in 311. Remember when we used fetch() , the default request method was get so when we wanted to post form data we had to write the attribute method=\"POST\" NOTE: in this use of the word method we mean something different than when we say an object's method . The method of fetch refers to the type of HTTP Request that will be sent. In our Express app we'll define methods on the app object that will act as routes to handle these types of/ method ical requests. Whew...moving on... So, while we're building our server we have to think about the potential requests types that may & will come to it from our front-end or some other developer using our API. They'll be sending POST types, GET types, PUTs and DELETEs. To design and build for those types of requests we use these built in methods: .get , .put , .post and .delete (that correspond to those types of request), by simply defining their value with the functionality we want them to do. To start doing this we begin writing them like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () app . use (( req , res , next ) => { next () }) // the GET Method app . get () // the POST Method app . post () // the PUT Method app . put () // the DELETE Method app . delete () app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) }) To continue defining the functionality of these methods we'll be putting some parameters inside each of these... The 1st Argument: the Path The path is a string that determines what route should be used. For example, all of our data will come through this one server so it needs to be pass through one root path: \"http://localhost:4000/\" . But if we wanted to serve user data and car data we'd need to define them at different paths. To do this we'd say that cars are at \"http://localhost:4000/cars\" and users are at \"http://localhost:4000/users\" . Therefore the path is \"/cars\" or \"/users\" . To define them you'd write it like this: 1 2 `app.get('/cars')` `app.get('/users')` We only need to define the last segment of the path: /users or /cars because our server lives at https://localhost:4000/ . Once our request from either Postman or our front-end app finds the server at the URL: https://localhost:4000/ , ( or any other URL it sits on once we host it remotely ), the path tells Express where to direct the request so that it finds the right route to get the expected resource (cars or users). if you look at the APIs we've worked with in 101 and 211 you'll see this same pattern used in those servers... /posts/ , /images , /products , /users , etc. Paths can also accept variables. Say that we wanted to obtain a specific user by their id , say 543 . In that case the full URL would be http://localhost:4000/users/543 . This will get the user whose id is equal to \"543\". But then someone might want user: 106, or user: 201, etc. To design for all of these potential request in our server we would write that route with a variable: :id . As in, 1 app . get ( '/users/:id' ) ` This is what our app starts to look like with that logic: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () app . use (( req , res , next ) => { next () }) // GET all users. Usually known as \"get all\" app . get ( \"/users\" ) // GET just one user by id. Usually known as \"get one\" app . get ( \"/users/:id\" ) // the POST Method app . post () // the PUT Method app . put () // the DELETE Method app . delete () app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) }) The 2nd Argument: a Callback Function After the path we have to define a second parameter that tells the server what's supposed to happen when this route is called. This second parameter is a callback function; meaning that this is what is suppose to happen when the method is called. In order for these callbacks to work they themselves need at least two argument passed into them: req (request) and res (response). The Req Parameter req represents the request object. This is the message that is sent from the frontend to our backend server. This object includes two main properties: headers and body . If you used Postman to submit a request with a body of { user: 'John' } then we could access that by referring to req.body . There are other properties of the incoming request that we can access as well, such as req.params , req.headers and req.cookies . NOTE: you must use a Cookie parser to do that last one. res represents the response object. This is what we will send back to the end user (client) on the frontend from the backend. We can send responses in a variety of formats but the two most popular are plain text and JSON. For example, let's say you want to send the text \"success\" to a user once an operation is complete. In that case you would complete whatever functionality you wanted inside of the callback and then call a the send method on the res object: res.send(\"success\") . The user will see this message after executing the specified action with our API. More commonly we are sending data payloads (data about a specific item: user or car, whatever) back to the user. On a GET request we might send the entire data object of a user back so that the client(front-end app/Postman). In that case, we called the json method on the res object to convert & package the data payload into a JSON string before we send it back to the client: res.json(user) . This user parameter could be anything we wanted but naming it this way helps us developers know what's supposed to be in there. The same logic would go for our car data: res.json(car) We will become more familiar with req and res as we practice more. However, now that we have our parameters and have a visual for the callback function we can put it all together. We mentioned previously that the first parameter is the path and the second parameter is the callback function , so when we write it all together we arrive at a variation of the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () // ...more code here... // GET method to get all users with the second argument including req & res that will resolve to a 'success' message being sent to the client/frontend app . get ( '/users' , ( req , res ) => { // ...perform some logic in here like getting the user data from the database... // then send back to the client a message saying 'success' res . send ( 'success' ) }) // GET method to get only one user by their id app . get ( '/users/:id' , ( req , res ) => { // ...store the id of the user request using the params of the req object coming from the client... const userId = req . params . id // ...get the user data from the database using the `userId` variable... // send the back to client a message saying 'success' res . send ( `We'll be sending you user ${ userId } shortly.` ) }) // ...more code here... // ...app.listen()... What you see above is a couple of routes/ endpoints . We will create many like these throughout this course. Take some time to understand how these methods work and the arguments that are being passed into them and what they are doing. In the coming sections we'll be adding on to these **endpoints to actually get data from a database so we can return actual data!!

We've also practiced consuming APIs with both Postman and Axios. So far, the APIs we've interacted with are programs that someone else has built. With Express, we will start to understand how to build our own APIs.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#what-is-expressjs","text":"Express is a (very popular) NPM package that turns our Node.js applications into a web server. Express can help us serve static files (images, etc) or create routes to build API endpoints. We will use Express to build the \"backend\" of our application. Why do we need a web server (or backend), anyway? There are several reasons. One key reason is for the protection of sensitive content. On our front-ends (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React), everything we code into the app will be visible from the browser in one way or another. That means that if you store an API key or some other sensitive token in a variable, eventually someone will be able to inspect the website (through the console) and obtain that information. This inspection is not possible with a web server built with Express. Another reason we use a server is that it is how we integrate with a database. We will become more familiar with databases in the following chapters but it's good to know that in the software industry (as a best practice) we don't connect to a database directly from the frontend, a React app for example. Most database systems don't even allow this interaction. So a web server helps us account for this as well. Express is an amazing tool that helps us quickly accomplish these tasks. Fortunately for us, there is a wealth of information available on Express and we will see some of that soon. For now, feel free to check out the Express Homepage . A breakdown of concepts:","title":"What is Express.js"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#initiating-the-server","text":"The first thing we typically do after we import express is to instantiate the server. The first few lines of our server usually look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // index.js // import the Express package const express = require ( 'express' ) // create a variable to hold the value of all of the server's functions/methods const app = express () // Middleware: this block is where authorization logic goes. We're not going to worry about it too much right now. We'll get into the details of authorization in a few weeks. app . use (( req , res , next ) => { //authorization logic would go here, after the check it calls the next() method to all the request to go to the next phase: get, put, post, etc... next () }) // at the bottom of the index.js file you'll tell the server `app` to listen give you feed back in the console when it is. // use this method to give you feedback as to when the server is successfully spun up (up and running)! app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) }) If this was in an npm init ed folder with Express installed ( npm i express ) you could run npm start or node index.js and get 'Server is listening on port 8080.' on your console.","title":"Initiating the Server"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#creating-routes","text":"After that we are free to start creating routes . The app object has properties on it already that include: .get , .put , .post and .delete (among others). These properties correspond to the HTTP request methods you learned about in 101, 211, and now in 311. Remember when we used fetch() , the default request method was get so when we wanted to post form data we had to write the attribute method=\"POST\" NOTE: in this use of the word method we mean something different than when we say an object's method . The method of fetch refers to the type of HTTP Request that will be sent. In our Express app we'll define methods on the app object that will act as routes to handle these types of/ method ical requests. Whew...moving on... So, while we're building our server we have to think about the potential requests types that may & will come to it from our front-end or some other developer using our API. They'll be sending POST types, GET types, PUTs and DELETEs. To design and build for those types of requests we use these built in methods: .get , .put , .post and .delete (that correspond to those types of request), by simply defining their value with the functionality we want them to do. To start doing this we begin writing them like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () app . use (( req , res , next ) => { next () }) // the GET Method app . get () // the POST Method app . post () // the PUT Method app . put () // the DELETE Method app . delete () app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) }) To continue defining the functionality of these methods we'll be putting some parameters inside each of these...","title":"Creating Routes"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#the-1st-argument-the-path","text":"The path is a string that determines what route should be used. For example, all of our data will come through this one server so it needs to be pass through one root path: \"http://localhost:4000/\" . But if we wanted to serve user data and car data we'd need to define them at different paths. To do this we'd say that cars are at \"http://localhost:4000/cars\" and users are at \"http://localhost:4000/users\" . Therefore the path is \"/cars\" or \"/users\" . To define them you'd write it like this: 1 2 `app.get('/cars')` `app.get('/users')` We only need to define the last segment of the path: /users or /cars because our server lives at https://localhost:4000/ . Once our request from either Postman or our front-end app finds the server at the URL: https://localhost:4000/ , ( or any other URL it sits on once we host it remotely ), the path tells Express where to direct the request so that it finds the right route to get the expected resource (cars or users). if you look at the APIs we've worked with in 101 and 211 you'll see this same pattern used in those servers... /posts/ , /images , /products , /users , etc. Paths can also accept variables. Say that we wanted to obtain a specific user by their id , say 543 . In that case the full URL would be http://localhost:4000/users/543 . This will get the user whose id is equal to \"543\". But then someone might want user: 106, or user: 201, etc. To design for all of these potential request in our server we would write that route with a variable: :id . As in, 1 app . get ( '/users/:id' ) ` This is what our app starts to look like with that logic: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () app . use (( req , res , next ) => { next () }) // GET all users. Usually known as \"get all\" app . get ( \"/users\" ) // GET just one user by id. Usually known as \"get one\" app . get ( \"/users/:id\" ) // the POST Method app . post () // the PUT Method app . put () // the DELETE Method app . delete () app . listen ( 8080 , () => { console . log ( 'Server is listening on port 8080.' ) })","title":"The 1st Argument: the Path"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#the-2nd-argument-a-callback-function","text":"After the path we have to define a second parameter that tells the server what's supposed to happen when this route is called. This second parameter is a callback function; meaning that this is what is suppose to happen when the method is called. In order for these callbacks to work they themselves need at least two argument passed into them: req (request) and res (response).","title":"The 2nd Argument: a Callback Function"},{"location":"module-1/introToExpress/#the-req-parameter","text":"req represents the request object. This is the message that is sent from the frontend to our backend server. This object includes two main properties: headers and body . If you used Postman to submit a request with a body of { user: 'John' } then we could access that by referring to req.body . There are other properties of the incoming request that we can access as well, such as req.params , req.headers and req.cookies . NOTE: you must use a Cookie parser to do that last one. res represents the response object. This is what we will send back to the end user (client) on the frontend from the backend. We can send responses in a variety of formats but the two most popular are plain text and JSON. For example, let's say you want to send the text \"success\" to a user once an operation is complete. In that case you would complete whatever functionality you wanted inside of the callback and then call a the send method on the res object: res.send(\"success\") . The user will see this message after executing the specified action with our API. More commonly we are sending data payloads (data about a specific item: user or car, whatever) back to the user. On a GET request we might send the entire data object of a user back so that the client(front-end app/Postman). In that case, we called the json method on the res object to convert & package the data payload into a JSON string before we send it back to the client: res.json(user) . This user parameter could be anything we wanted but naming it this way helps us developers know what's supposed to be in there. The same logic would go for our car data: res.json(car) We will become more familiar with req and res as we practice more. However, now that we have our parameters and have a visual for the callback function we can put it all together. We mentioned previously that the first parameter is the path and the second parameter is the callback function , so when we write it all together we arrive at a variation of the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 // index.js const express = require ( 'express' ) const app = express () // ...more code here... // GET method to get all users with the second argument including req & res that will resolve to a 'success' message being sent to the client/frontend app . get ( '/users' , ( req , res ) => { // ...perform some logic in here like getting the user data from the database... // then send back to the client a message saying 'success' res . send ( 'success' ) }) // GET method to get only one user by their id app . get ( '/users/:id' , ( req , res ) => { // ...store the id of the user request using the params of the req object coming from the client... const userId = req . params . id // ...get the user data from the database using the `userId` variable... // send the back to client a message saying 'success' res . send ( `We'll be sending you user ${ userId } shortly.` ) }) // ...more code here... // ...app.listen()...

JavaScript, why? JavaScript was originally designed to work on the web and so it only ran in browsers (Chrome/Safari/IE). Its purpose was to add functionality to websites to make them interactive and it has been very successful in this regard. Eventually, experts in the language decided they wanted to take the benefits of JavaScript and use them OUTSIDE of a web browser, for example on a server, and thus Node.js was born. Node.js is an open-source environment that executes JavaScript outside of a web browser. Why? While there are many benefits of using JavaScript, we'll focus on the big one for you as the developer. You may have heard the term fullstack used in the software industry to reference a person who works on both the frontend and the backend. The frontend almost always includes JavaScript while the backend could be any assortment of server-side languages such as Java, C# or Python. Because of this, many traditional full-stack developers were proficient in at least two languages. Adding Node.js into that mix allows the developer to focus on only one, JavaScript. With Node.js, we can run JavaScript on both the client side and the server. See It - What is Node.js Practice It Open the Repl.it below. Alter the function to include functionality for an international phone number. Ex. (+1). Add one number to the beginning of the array to support this. Additionally, remove all formatting (besides the +) from the phone number such that the result is returned as +19775631212 . This should make the logic of the function very simple. Without the advent of Node.js, we wouldn't be able to use JavaScript as a scripting language in the terminal as we can here in this Repl.it example or in our own terminal on our personal machine. Try It on Your Personal Machine By the time you come to this course you should have installed Node.js and be able to type into your terminal/bash node -v to get the current version of Node.js you have installed and running. On your desktop, create a file called: myTestFile.js and open it with your text editor, VS Code or your preference. Copy/paste the code from the Repl.it into that file, save, and return to your terminal/bash. cd desktop to change into your Desktop directory. Run the command node myTestFile.js + Enter You should see the same results you saw in the Repl.it online terminal. Now delete the file myTestFile.js to keep your desktop clean and organized. This is the power of Node.js. Without it, JavaScript couldn't be run outside of your browser. Try it in the Browser Now go back to Chrome and type Cmd + Option + I or ++ctrl+shift+i+ to open your dev tools tray. Navigate to the console. Copy/paste the formatPhone function into the console and hit Enter . Copy/paste the invocation of the function formatPhone([9, 7, 7, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]) and hit Enter .

If you built a web page like you did in 101 and added functionality to it with JavaScript, the code was running in the browser. But if you were running unit tests on your terminal apps like you did in JS211, your JavaScript code was running in the Node environment. Without having to switch between a front-end scripting language and a back-end programming language we can focus all of our attention on one language, JavaScript.

The short checklist looks like this: Download Chrome Download VS Code Terminal: MacOS has a built-in terminal Windows 10+ has Command Prompt Windows <=9 will need to download GitBash Download Node See It Chrome When consuming content through the internet, users/we need a program that can render the streams of data sent to our computer (laptop or phone) from other computers (the cloud) through the internet. The general name for this type of program is called a browser. Yes, you can surf the internet with other browsers like Internet Explore, Edge, Opera, Firefox or Safari, but Chrome undoubtedly has the strongest built-in dev tools of any browser. In this course and all the following courses we\u2019ll be using Chrome. Be sure to download Chrome. After that: Master Bookmark Management Organized Your Bookmarks Shortcut Practice: Cmd + T = open new tab Shortcut Practice: Cmd + Shift + T = reopen last closed tab Shortcut Practice: Cmd + R = refresh the current tab Shortcut Practice: Cmd + W = close the current tab NOTE: For Windows machines use Ctrl instead of Cmd . VS Code A text editor is simply a tool used to edit your code and organize it into files before it is executed. There are plenty of text editors or IDEs including Atom, SublimeText, IntelliJ, Brackets, WebStorm, VIM, TextWrangler, RubyMine and even NotePad. Some are paid, others are free, but for our use-case and to get the most powerful text editor for the buck we're going to use the free and well-supported Visual Studio Code . Be sure to download it and then continue to read up on other text editors as you grow as a developer. IDEs and TextEditors Why VS Code Learn & Practice More Keyboard Shortcuts NOTE: VS Code, Visual Studio and VS Community are all different text editors . Think of the terminal or CLI (command line interface) as a shortcut to the computer. Normally we access our computer's programs and files through a GUI (graphical user interface, pronounced: \"gooey\"). A GUI is nice and pretty, but sometimes we need to access the computer more directly and in a more efficient way. We can do this using the command line interface, or command line for short. Terminal or Terminal Emulator A terminal or Command Line Interface(CLI) is a way for you to interact with your computer's core functionality without building a GUI. GUI are what we give to people that don't know how to work with computers. We learn to work in terminals because later on we'll be interacting with remote servers and the only way we can talk to them is sending them messages through a CLI command. Macs Mac users have a built in terminal. To access it, simply hold Cmd + Space A Spotlight search bar should appear. Type in \"terminal\" then hit Enter . But you'll need homebrew so run this in your terminal: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" and say yes to XCode .

That's a huge step and we should be very proud of that! We're quickly learning how to become a \"back-end\" developer. Today we are going to build on that knowledge and talk about data relationships and how they can help us achieve even more impressive results. We will learn more about tables , rows ( entities ) as well as the keys that help form relationships between them, hence relational database . We will end with more advanced SELECT statements that JOIN tables together to achieve more complex results. We're going to discuss a few topics today and then end with practice JOIN ing tables together. So first we need to understand how relationships work between our data. Tables/Rows We saw this in our last lesson but didn't touch on it in too much detail. Basically, all of the data we store in our database will exist in tables . Tables are logical groupings of data based on shared characteristics. For example, all users (in our last example) had a first_name , last_name , address , etc. The same would be true for cars or products, we would put them in their own table because the share similar characteristics or properties. These \"properties\", known as fields are the columns of the table and the rows are each individual entity within our dataset . Remember this table from last lesson? id email age first_name password 001 bob@email.com 55 Bob B wonderful55 002 sarah@email.com 75 Sarah F turtleLove1955 003 emily@email.com 25 Emily T rainbowHearts33 The value in each of these cells of the user is called an entry . In the table above we see 5 fields , 3 entities , and 15 entries The rows, or entities represent each item in our table. For example, there is one row for each \"user\". When we query our data we are looking to return the rows that match our criteria. In the \"users\" example we may look for each row (\"user\") that has a first_name that starts with S . 1 SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' This query would return all the fields of user 002: | 002 | sarah@email.com | 75 | Sarah F | turtleLove1955 | because their first_name begins with an S . How do we know how many rows exist in my table? Try running the following SQL command: 1 SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM users If you do this on the \"users\" table from last class you should see the number 500. NOTE: MySQL has many commands built into the language and all you have to do is read them, play with them, and move them into your server's codebase when you build the query that returns what you're looking for. That's why we use MySQL Workbench!! Keys Keys are indexes in MySQL, just like indexes in JavaScript Arrays. What does that mean? Well . . . it's simply the way in which MySQL works to organize data. There are three types of keys that we need to be concerned with. They are primary , unique and foreign . Primary Key A primary key is a field that identifies each row in the table. It could technically be a group of columns but we won't talk about that now as that technique is out of fashion What we need to remember is the three rules of primary keys : It must be unique to each row; and cannot be null . Also, these keys are almost always numbers, not strings, since MySQL naturally works faster with numbers and speed will eventually be a concern if we have a big dataset. In many cases, the primary key is an auto-increment ing number like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. or like the table above: 001 , 002 , 003 , and so forth. It's important to note: a table can only have one primary key . Unique Key A unique key enforces uniqueness on specific columns of your data. There can be many unique keys on a table. An easy example of this will be referencing our \"users\" data again. Let's say that we have a bunch of user data but no two users should have the same email address. In this case we have to place a unique key on the email column and MySQL will prevent us from inserting duplicates. Foreign Key Foreign keys help us manage the relationship between tables. These fields have the same meaning in different tables and help us reduce redundancy. Let's say our \"users\" data is split up into two tables. One is called \"users\" and one is called \"userContacts\". | users table | | id | first_name | | - | - | | 001 | emily | | 002 | erica | | 003 | beverly| | usersContacts table | | user_id | email | street_address | phone | - | - | - | - | | 001 | emily@email.com | 123 Michigan Street | 555-555-5555 | | 002 | erica@email.com | 34 Miracle Street | 555-555-5555 | | 003 | beverly@email.com | 123 Magic Street | 555-555-5555 | The first table contains users id s and first_name s and the second contains their phone numbers and email & street_addresses . We would put the user id on the \"usersContacts\" table as a foreign key which helps relate that data to the first table (\"users\"). It also prevents us from adding to \"usersContacts\" without first adding to \"users\" since we would want to avoid an orphaned record in \"usersContacts\" that has no \"user\". Foreign keys are also used frequently to JOIN tables. A more visual example might help here. Note: Foreign keys are the most difficult to understand so don't worry if you can't visualize it in your mind just yet. The practice and homework will help enforce this principle JOIN Ok, we've done all the hard work of getting our tables set up with the appropriate keys and you're scratching your head because it only partially makes sense( or none at all... ). That's fine. Here comes the fun part ( hopefully )! If you had fun understanding SELECT and realizing how powerful it is to perform queries, just wait. Now we are going to start combining tables together. Because we've used foreign keys to form relationships between our data, we can now SELECT data from multiple tables that meets our criteria. Check this out: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT users . first_name , usersContact . email FROM users JOIN usersContact WHERE users . id = usersContact . user_id ; So what's going on here? first_name only exists on the users table and email only exists on the usersContact table but because we've created a relationship between the two tables (via the foreign_key , user_id on the \"usersContact\" table) we can now SELECT data from both and know that we are guaranteed to have a usersContact for each \"user\". Why split the data? You might be asking yourself: \"Why did we take the original 'users' table and split the data into two tables?\" There are a few answers to this including normalization but what I'd like to touch on here is business impact. We might want to get a list of all user emails in the system. But we don't necessarily care what the users names or addresses are we just want to email everyone something. In this case it's beneficial to our system that we don't have to retrieve unnecessary information. The dataset would be a lot larger with all the additional fields included. Also, it might be possible for a user to have multiple contacts (phones, emails). If that's the case it's great that the data is split up so that we can just create a new entry in the \"usersContact\" table and not have to create a whole new user entirely. We'll take a look at our new data in the homework. Check out the Addition Resources ! Practice It - JOIN Follow the link to open this DBfiddle Alter the SQL fiddle: In the schema SQL, change the \"firstName\" column to be \"seller\" instead ( There are two instances to find and change ). Change your Query SQL to ask for the correct field name \"seller\" Move the price to be before the items' names and descriptions in the query return. GROUP BY The GROUP BY statement does pretty much what its name implies. It allows us to group data by a certain criteria. The caveat is that you can only display the fields that appear in the GROUP BY clause when you are viewing the data. That is, unless we specify an aggregate function such as COUNT or SUM for the rest of the data. It's very common to use COUNT with GROUP BY so let's see an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT county , count ( * ) FROM users GROUP BY county ; The above will display a list of all the counties and a count of the users in each one. If we try to add an additional field into the select, such as \"phone1\" we get: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT county , phone1 count ( * ) FROM users GROUP BY county ; 1 Error Code: 1055. Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains non-aggregated column 'admin.users.phone1' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by That is because there are multiple options for \"phone1\" and SQL doesn't know how to group them as we haven't specified that. We could sum the phone numbers ( SUM(phone1) ) and that would work but it would show us useless information. Why would we ever want the \"sum\" of a phone number? HAVING The HAVING clause is a lot easier. It's basically a WHERE clause for the GROUP BY . It allows us to display only aggregated information that matches our criteria. For example, show me a list of all the counties and the number of users who live in each one, but only if there are more than 5 users in it. We would write that like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT county , count ( * ) AS tally FROM users GROUP BY county HAVING tally > 5 ; You may notice the word tally in there. We've simply renamed the count(*) field to \"tally\" so that we don't have to keep specifying it in the previous manner. Now this query will show me all counties where the tally is greater than 5. We will practice with this more in the upcoming project. Be sure to read ahead, read the docs below, and answer the Questions for Discussion for yourself before class.

What does that mean? Well . . . it's simply the way in which MySQL works to organize data. There are three types of keys that we need to be concerned with. They are primary , unique and foreign .","title":"Keys"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#primary-key","text":"A primary key is a field that identifies each row in the table. It could technically be a group of columns but we won't talk about that now as that technique is out of fashion What we need to remember is the three rules of primary keys : It must be unique to each row; and cannot be null . Also, these keys are almost always numbers, not strings, since MySQL naturally works faster with numbers and speed will eventually be a concern if we have a big dataset. In many cases, the primary key is an auto-increment ing number like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. or like the table above: 001 , 002 , 003 , and so forth. It's important to note: a table can only have one primary key .","title":"Primary Key"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#unique-key","text":"A unique key enforces uniqueness on specific columns of your data. There can be many unique keys on a table. An easy example of this will be referencing our \"users\" data again. Let's say that we have a bunch of user data but no two users should have the same email address. In this case we have to place a unique key on the email column and MySQL will prevent us from inserting duplicates.","title":"Unique Key"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#foreign-key","text":"Foreign keys help us manage the relationship between tables. These fields have the same meaning in different tables and help us reduce redundancy. Let's say our \"users\" data is split up into two tables. One is called \"users\" and one is called \"userContacts\". | users table | | id | first_name | | - | - | | 001 | emily | | 002 | erica | | 003 | beverly| | usersContacts table | | user_id | email | street_address | phone | - | - | - | - | | 001 | emily@email.com | 123 Michigan Street | 555-555-5555 | | 002 | erica@email.com | 34 Miracle Street | 555-555-5555 | | 003 | beverly@email.com | 123 Magic Street | 555-555-5555 | The first table contains users id s and first_name s and the second contains their phone numbers and email & street_addresses . We would put the user id on the \"usersContacts\" table as a foreign key which helps relate that data to the first table (\"users\"). It also prevents us from adding to \"usersContacts\" without first adding to \"users\" since we would want to avoid an orphaned record in \"usersContacts\" that has no \"user\". Foreign keys are also used frequently to JOIN tables. A more visual example might help here. Note: Foreign keys are the most difficult to understand so don't worry if you can't visualize it in your mind just yet. The practice and homework will help enforce this principle","title":"Foreign Key"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#join","text":"Ok, we've done all the hard work of getting our tables set up with the appropriate keys and you're scratching your head because it only partially makes sense( or none at all... ). That's fine. Here comes the fun part ( hopefully )! If you had fun understanding SELECT and realizing how powerful it is to perform queries, just wait. Now we are going to start combining tables together. Because we've used foreign keys to form relationships between our data, we can now SELECT data from multiple tables that meets our criteria. Check this out: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT users . first_name , usersContact . email FROM users JOIN usersContact WHERE users . id = usersContact . user_id ; So what's going on here? first_name only exists on the users table and email only exists on the usersContact table but because we've created a relationship between the two tables (via the foreign_key , user_id on the \"usersContact\" table) we can now SELECT data from both and know that we are guaranteed to have a usersContact for each \"user\".","title":"JOIN"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#why-split-the-data","text":"You might be asking yourself: \"Why did we take the original 'users' table and split the data into two tables?\" There are a few answers to this including normalization but what I'd like to touch on here is business impact. We might want to get a list of all user emails in the system. But we don't necessarily care what the users names or addresses are we just want to email everyone something. In this case it's beneficial to our system that we don't have to retrieve unnecessary information. The dataset would be a lot larger with all the additional fields included. Also, it might be possible for a user to have multiple contacts (phones, emails). If that's the case it's great that the data is split up so that we can just create a new entry in the \"usersContact\" table and not have to create a whole new user entirely. We'll take a look at our new data in the homework. Check out the Addition Resources !","title":"Why split the data?"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#practice-it-join","text":"Follow the link to open this DBfiddle Alter the SQL fiddle: In the schema SQL, change the \"firstName\" column to be \"seller\" instead ( There are two instances to find and change ). Change your Query SQL to ask for the correct field name \"seller\" Move the price to be before the items' names and descriptions in the query return.","title":"Practice It - JOIN"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#group-by","text":"The GROUP BY statement does pretty much what its name implies. It allows us to group data by a certain criteria. The caveat is that you can only display the fields that appear in the GROUP BY clause when you are viewing the data. That is, unless we specify an aggregate function such as COUNT or SUM for the rest of the data. It's very common to use COUNT with GROUP BY so let's see an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 SELECT county , count ( * ) FROM users GROUP BY county ; The above will display a list of all the counties and a count of the users in each one. If we try to add an additional field into the select, such as \"phone1\" we get: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT county , phone1 count ( * ) FROM users GROUP BY county ; 1 Error Code: 1055. Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains non-aggregated column 'admin.users.phone1' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by That is because there are multiple options for \"phone1\" and SQL doesn't know how to group them as we haven't specified that. We could sum the phone numbers ( SUM(phone1) ) and that would work but it would show us useless information. Why would we ever want the \"sum\" of a phone number?","title":"GROUP BY"},{"location":"module-2/advancedSELECTstatments/#having","text":"The HAVING clause is a lot easier. It's basically a WHERE clause for the GROUP BY . It allows us to display only aggregated information that matches our criteria. For example, show me a list of all the counties and the number of users who live in each one, but only if there are more than 5 users in it. We would write that like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT county , count ( * ) AS tally FROM users GROUP BY county HAVING tally > 5 ; You may notice the word tally in there. We've simply renamed the count(*) field to \"tally\" so that we don't have to keep specifying it in the previous manner. Now this query will show me all counties where the tally is greater than 5.

NOTE 2: One important clause that we haven't talked about yet is the ORDER BY clause . It will help you order the data in your tables by a field or group of fields. For example, if you just inserted a record, you may want to perform a SELECT statement in descending \"order by\" id so that the newest record is at the top. The video above will explain this clause.","title":"Creation Time, 60-90 mins"},{"location":"module-2/class-7/#push-yourself-further","text":"The following document covers INSERT s, UPDATE s and DELETE s as well as commands to create and drop tables and databases.

Hunger Overview We've spent the last few days learning how to use Express.js to build a server. But as you've probably picked up by now, holding our data in a static folder isn't ideal for large and dynamic apps. We need data to persist and allow multiple users to interact with the same set of data. To do this we need a third element added to our full-stack app: a database Today we're going to learn what, how, and where to setup databases . What is A Database A database is an organized set of data stored and accessed electronically. It helps provide a layer of persistence to our applications. That means, even if our application breaks or is shut down, we can still access its data. Next time the app starts up, it should be able to pick up where it left off. We can integrate with our database in multiple ways. One of those ways is through our server built with Express. This is how our users will interact with our dataset. We can also use our terminals/command lines and various other visual tools to query this data from outside our application/server. This becomes very useful in debugging, for example. There are many types of databases available to us but in this course we will focus on one of the most popular, MySQL . MySQL MySQL has many interesting capabilities including the ability to combine NoSQL and SQL (sometimes known as non-relational and relational, respectively) in a single database. We will be focusing on the SQL side of things. This means that all of our data will be structured in \"tables\" and those tables will have \"relationships\", hence relational. We will come to understand this more in the coming weeks. For now let's talk about the two types of operations we can perform on our databases, read and write . Read vs Write Read A read operation means we are fetching or reading some data from the database. You can think of this like the GET requests we learned about previously. In MySQL, this manifests itself in the form of SELECT statements. We use that keyword ( select ) to retrieve a subset of data based on some criteria that we pass in. Write A write operation is something that creates , updates or deletes data. These could correspond to our POST , PUT and DELETE HTTP request types we've learned and built already. The MySQL keywords that represent these actions are: INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE . How Data is Stored When we create a database using some flavor of SQL, like mySQL we divided our types of data into tables . Using past examples we might have a users table and a cars table and a products table. All of these tables could be in the same database but keeping them in separate tables allows us to keep and organize related data within \"categories\". In side the tables we divide our individual entities up by fields . If you were looking at an spreadsheet the fields would be the columns while the rows would be the entities . So each user in our users table would be an entity but their properties/attributes like id , email , age , name , password , etc... would all be fields . The value in each of these fields of the user is called an entry . In the following table we see 5 fields , 3 entities , and 15 entries id email age name password 001 bob@email.com 55 Bob B wonderful55 002 sarah@email.com 75 Sarah F turtleLove1955 003 emily@email.com 25 Emily T rainbowHearts33 Make sense? SELECT Statements Now that down, let's take a deeper look into SELECT statements. This will be our first foray into the world of MySQL. SELECT is a keyword that we use when we want to query data from our database. Other keywords were mentioned above ( INSERT , UPDATE ) and it's important to note that these keywords are typically written in capital letters. Let's start with an example of SELECT : 1 SELECT * FROM adminAccounts This query selects everything(*) from the adminAccounts table. Let's talk about what's going on here: We are using SELECT to tell the database management system ( DBMS ) that we are querying/asking for data. The asterisk , * , is known as a wildcard and its role is to include all fields in the query. The keyword FROM exists in all SELECT statements and is a precursor to the final argument. The final part/argument of this statement, the word adminAccounts , is the name of the table in the database that we are querying. Think of SELECT as a function and you're passing it two arguments: * , and a function FROM which itself gets an argument, which in this case is adminAccounts . The following code is NOT valid!! But may help you start seeing the pattern: 1 2 3 4 */ not valid mysql code */ used for illustrative purposes only SELECT ( * , FROM ( adminAccounts )) AGAIN, the code above is not valid but may help you see a pattern since you're familiar with JavaScript. Let's look at a more complicated example: 1 SELECT SUM ( logins ) FROM adminAccounts WHERE firstName LIKE 'd%' This query selects the sum of all the logins by users whose first name starts with the letter \"d\". Let's break it down once again: We start with the SELECT keyword. This time we use the SUM keyword combined with the field \"logins\" to get a total of all the logins. We see FROM again to help us determine which table to query from. Designate the adminAccounts table again. Now we are going to use the WHERE keyword which helps us narrow our search to specific result sets. We specify that we want to return only rows/ entities where the first name starts with the letter d . That's what the LIKE keyword paired with d% does. The percentage sign, % , is a wildcard . The wildcard allows for anything to come after the d like David, Dana, Devin, Deidre , all of these would match and be returned. Now we have two working examples of SELECT statements.

In addition, we want our data to persist on a computer that's available globally, literally globally to all those with an internet connection. To do this we need to put our data in a database that is hosted on a service like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud (GCP). The video below shows you how to sign-up and use GCP to host a MySQL database but before you jump into that let's first get a big picture of what we're doing. The Big Picture We're learning how to build servers using Express.js. These servers will serve data to our front-end app we build in 411, thus a full-stack application. But we need to have a database to keep up with our data. Today you're going to sign-up for a GCP account and get free credit to run what's called a virtual machine (VM). This is going to be called an instance in the video below. The instance will work just like your personal computer. It will be a computer running on a very large computer somewhere in the world. This credit will go toward paying for that computer to run and accept requests. Once your server is built you'll host it on GCP, AWS, Heroku, or where ever. This too will be on a computer/virtual machine that is running and accepting requests and sending requests to your database. Then you'll build your front-end app using React. This will also be its own app and will need to run on a virtual machine somewhere like AWS, Azure, etc. The Costs of Hosting All of this costs money! Hosting apps and websites is not free. It costs money. We introduce you to GCP because it's an industry standard like Azure and AWS. As you move through this program you will likely run our of credit. Don't agree to pay for more and you won't be charged more! However, as you approach graduation you might need to move your DB, Server App, and Front-end(Client) app from GCP to Heroku or AWS to save money.

We used SELECT to query data in a lot of different ways and we understand how tables provide relationships to our data. Today we are going to learn about the rest of the CRUD operations in SQL. Reminder: CRUD is an acronym that stands for: C reate, R ead, U pdate, D elete These are the basic operations we use to obtain and mutate (change) data. You'll hear this acronym used to reference APIs and, most frequently, database operations. You'll hear often that at the end of your course and by graduation you will have built a full-stack CRUD app. In terms of CRUD, we've already learned the \"R\" (read/ SELECT ). Now we will learn about INSERT /Create, UPDATE and DELETE . These operations will give us full control of our datasets. INSERT The INSERT command inserts an item (or a group of items) into the specified table. You can see bulk inserts in the initialize.sql file of your previous two homework assignments. An INSERT statement looks like this: 1 2 3 4 INSERT INTO users ( firstName , lastName , age ) VALUES ( 'matt' , 'miller' , 35 ); Notice how the values match up (in order) with the names of the fields. id firstName lastName age 1 bob brandy 55 2 sarah sassafrass 75 3 emily erlanger 25 Question: There's an \"id\" field on this table that we don't see in the INSERT command. Why doesn't the \"id\" field need to be written in the INSERT statement? Check out/Google the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword for the answer to this question. UPDATE The UPDATE command updates a row or set of rows that match a certain criteria. You can change one or more fields in the dataset as long as they aren't PRIMARY KEYS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 UPDATE users SET first_name = 'Artie' WHERE id = 3 ; The statement above changes (SETs) the first name of user 3 to \"Artie\": Artie erlanger . DELETE The DELETE command removes a row or group of rows that match a certain condition. It's important to be careful with the DELETE command because you could inadvertently remove too many rows if you aren't specific with your WHERE clause. When that happens there's no getting that data back, short of a DB backup, and that can be time consuming and also assumes that you backed up your database in the first place. That being said, a DELETE command looks like this: 1 2 3 4 DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 3 ; The statement above DELETE s the user from the users table whose ( WHERE ) id is equal to 3 . What if you wanted to DELETE multiple users by id : 1 2 3 4 DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN ( 3 , 4 , 5 ); That's great! Users 3, 4 and 5 have been deleted. Notice how the IN() looks like a function? You can pass multiple parameters to it. But our deletions are not limited to removing records by their id s. Everything we can do with the WHERE clause in SELECT applies to DELETE . 1 2 3 4 DELETE FROM users WHERE firstName LIKE 'a%' ; The above query deletes all users from the database whose first name starts with the letter 'a'. Hopefully we are starting to see how this can become dangerous. Don't attempt to run queries like this in a production environment. Instead, we would look to see if there is more specific criteria we could use.
